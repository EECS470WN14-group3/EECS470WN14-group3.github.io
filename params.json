{"name":"EECS470 WN14 Group 3","tagline":"Code, laughs, and l33t hack5 by mmmkk","body":"Howdy,\r\n\r\nLooks like you've stumbled upon our EECS470 Project Repo. You __won't__ find our processor, or pretty much any SystemVerilog code in here (because that would be super cheating). You __will__ find a bunch of (hopefully) useful scripts and documentation. And maybe a few laughs as well.\r\n\r\nBase GitHub page at <https://github.com/EECS470WN14-group3>\r\n\r\n### Flux Documentation\r\nOne of the (arguably) useful things that we did was build synthesis using Flux. Check out [/flux-documentation](http://eecs470wn14-group3.github.io/flux-documentation/) for a bangin' gitbook with documentation for the entire process. Code (ie: `markdown` files) in [the repo](https://github.com/EECS470WN14-group3/flux-documentation).\r\n\r\n### Flux Example Scripts\r\nSome example code to complement the gitbook is available in the [example scripts repo](https://github.com/EECS470WN14-group3/flux-practical-scripts).\r\n\r\n### Useful Scripts for the CAEN Environment\r\n[Some scripts](https://github.com/EECS470WN14-group3/laughs-and-l33t-hack5) for making CAEN a little more useful. HACKS FTW!\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n-mmmkk","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
